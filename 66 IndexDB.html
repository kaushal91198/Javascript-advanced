    //a low level API for storing structured data,including large datasets
    //it is essentially like a server side database
    //we can store information using keys
    // we can crate indexes on those keys to optimize searching and reading data
    //and most importantly, we can store tons of information like gigs, gigabytes of information compared to what, five megabytes with local storage and session storage
    //so it can handle a lot more volume, lot more data
    //it also supports versioned schemas
    //we can have different schemas and different versions to manage and store data
    //with some of key differences though, it's asynchornous,so it does not block JS like local
    //it is asynchronous, it doesn't currenltly support promises

    // Storage limit for local and session Storage - 5 MB


    //create the database 
    const open = indexedDB.open("MyFirstDB", 2);//second argument is for versioning
    // this callback is going to run if the database needs to be upgraded or created

    open.onupgradeneeded = () => {
        const db = open.result;
        db.createObjectStore("MyUserStore", { keyPath: "id" });//first argument is name of my object store and second thing we can provide is called Key path.
    };

    open.onsuccess = () => {
        console.log("SUCCESS!!!");
        const db = open.result;
        //unfortunately it's not as simple as inserting the data right away
        //everything has to be done through transactions 
        const transaction = db.transaction("MyUserStore", "readwrite");
        const store = transaction.objectStore("MyUserStore");

        store.put({ id: 2, username: "Brandy", age: 9 });
        store.put({ id: 3, username: "Brandon", age: 12 });
        store.put({ id: 4, username: "Brady", age: 34 });
        const largeString = new Array(5 * 1024 * 1024 + 1).join("a");
        store.put({ id: 5, username: largeString });
        const user = store.getAll();
        const userFive = store.get(5);

        user.onsuccess = () => {
            console.log(user.result);
        };
        userFive.onsuccess = () => {
            console.log(userFive.result);
        };

        transaction.oncomplete = () => {
            db.close();
        };
    };

    open.onerror = () => {
        console.log("ERROR!");
    };


    //it is tied in the same way local storage is tied to particular website, the domain and protocal
    //so it's not like session storage where it goes away between these different sessions
